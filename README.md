# Paddle-Skeleton-Action-Recognition

DecoupleGCN-DropGraph, ASGCN, AGCN, STGCN.

You need to download [Paddle Video](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleVideo) and add them in the folder about action recognition.

Ensamble these methods can yield good results. We won the top 1% in the figure skater action recognition competition held by Baidu 2021.
